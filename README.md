OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.  The OpenTelemetry Collector is a constituent of opentelemetry and  can collect data from OpenTelemetry SDKs and other sources. This project is a component generator for the OpenTelemetry collector. The Opentelemetry collector has various components like Extensions, Receivers, Exporters, and Processors. The aim of the project generate skeleto code of the various collector components.

### Installation

You can download the binary [here](#). Place in your system's PATH environment variable. You can follow the tutorial [here](https://chlee.co/how-to-setup-environment-variables-for-windows-mac-and-linux/)

## Example usage:

```bash
ocg --component exporter --output example --signal trace,log --module mycomponent
```
Note: If any of the value is not supplied as a flag. It would be requested interactively.

### Example usage without binary

```bash
go run . --component exporter --output example --signal trace,log --module mycomponent
```
Note:

- If any of the value is not supplied as a flag. It would be requested interactively.
- Ensure you ahave GO installed, if not, install [here](https://go.dev/dl/)

### How it works

The component generator has different flags:

- component:
It is used to specify the type of component to be generated. The following are the accepted values: exporter,processor,extension,receiver. Only one can be specified at a time.

- output:
It is used to indicate the location in which the generated source code would live in. The input should be string value.

- signal:
It is used to indicate the signal(s) associated with a component. The accepted values are: trace,metric,log. More than one can be specified at a time but should be delimited with a comma and no whitespaces in between. e.g. --signal trace,metric.

- module:
It is used to indicate the name of the module to be generated
